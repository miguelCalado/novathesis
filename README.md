* NOVA University Lisbon
    * [NOVA School for Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt) (FCT-NOVA)
    * [NOVA Information Management School](https://www.novaims.unl.pt) (NOVA-IMS)

The template is also easily customizable, including the support for new Schools. Currently the template supports out-of-the-box (at least): 17 Chapter Styles, 7 font sets, 9 schools.
